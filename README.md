This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This program aims to showcase the application of the Algopay project. It combines a basic React.js application with Algorand SDK and Firebase to allow users to send Algo to each other without the corresponding public key. It achieves this by linking the public key to the phone number of each user the latter being used instead of the cryptocurrency address. It provides an interactive framework with a preexisting list of authenticated users.

To run project, we need to go in "algopay" folder and run "npm start".
